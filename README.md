# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Hubspot Fun
A collection of practical, real-world HubSpot scripts, automations, and workflow hacks that make my life easier‚Äîand might just help you too.

# üìÉ Scripts
### 1. Smart Contact Deduplication Script for HubSpot Workflows

# 1. Smart Contact Deduplication Script for HubSpot Workflows
Uses a series of prioritized matching strategies to identify duplicate contacts.
## Matching Steps:
1. First name + Last name + Phone number
2. First name + Last name + Email address
3. First name + Last name + Email username
4. Exact Email address match
5. Email username + root domain (e.g., "user" + "company")
6. Normalized Email username (ignores dots)
7. First name + Last name + (candidate has no email)
8. First name + Last name + Company name

## Behavior:
- If no matches are found, the workflow ends with no action
- If exactly one match is found, the enrolled contact is merged into the surviving contact
- If multiple matches are found, the workflow ends without merging
- Merge survivor is determined by most recent hs_analytics_last_timestamp
- Includes logging, API throttling, and error handling
